To deploy a Sage theme you'll need to make sure two things are covered:

1. Run `composer install` from the theme directory on the remote server
2. Copy over production theme assets

## Generating production ready theme assets

Generate production ready assets with `yarn build:production`, which will build your assets with versioned filenames.

If you use [Trellis](/trellis/), you can build your assets locally, then copy them to the remote server during deployment. [See the `build-before.yml` example hook](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/master/deploy-hooks/build-before.yml) in Trellis.
