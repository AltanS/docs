# Compatibility

A list of currently known compatibility issues with any WordPress plugins and Sage. Also take a look at the [Acorn compatibility](/acorn/docs/compatibility/) docs.

## Adding support for plugins

### WooCommerce 

WooCommerce support for Sage can be added by using the [generoi/sage-woocommerce](https://github.com/generoi/sage-woocommerce) package.

## Known issues with plugins

- Disqus Comment System is [not compatible with Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage/issues/2035#issuecomment-369673419). There is a [Laravel-based solution](https://github.com/yajra/laravel-disqus) which may work (untested).
