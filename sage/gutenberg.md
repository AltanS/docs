Gutenberg support has not yet officially landed in Sage. You can follow the pull request by [Kelly Mears](https://kellymears.me/) for an example of how to integrate Gutenberg into your theme:

[Native Gutenberg templating and styles (#2144)](https://github.com/roots/sage/pull/2144)

Sage 10, which is still in development, has introduced some initial editor support. This page will be updated with more info soon!
