# Support

While we strive to help our customers in any way we can, a Radicle license doesn't cover the Roots team troubleshooting any application code issues that aren't directly related to Radicle itself.

## Bug reports, feature requests, and feedback

If you discover a bug in Radicle, please make a topic on [Roots Discourse](https://discourse.roots.io/c/radicle) with minimal reproduction instructions.

If you have feature requests, questions, or feedback, please make a topic on [Roots Discourse](https://discourse.roots.io/c/radicle) or use the #radicle channel on our Discord server.
